# Solvent Protocol - Bringing liquidity to your NFTs on Solana.

## So what's the fuss all about?

Solvent helps you with access to DeFi services using your NFTs so that your JPEG sitting in your wallet can be more useful than just for your Twitter/Discord PFP.

You deposit your NFT in a Solvent "bucket" in exchange of "droplets" that you can either use to swap for another NFT or cash out on Serum.

 - Discover better floor prices for your NFTs and cash out using pools on Serum.
 - Trading your SolPunk for another SolPunk made easy.
 - Still wanna go long on your NFT collection? Provide liquidity on Serum and gain additional LP rewards.
